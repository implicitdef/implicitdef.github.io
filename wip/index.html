<p class="l2"><span class="i-write-code">I write code</span> <span class="parenthesis">(for money) (also sometimes for fun)</span></p>


<p class="rest">I build clean, well-thought-out and scalable software and webapps. I often find myself obsessing over the smallest detail and edge case. I code, ship, and maintain.</p>

<p class="rest">I offer my services as a freelancer. In the past, I have worked for a data vizualisation startup, a major player of french e-commmerce, and a digital certificates company.</p>

<p class="rest">I'm always looking into the latests tools and languages to practice my trade. For the moment I'm deeply in love with Scala and React.js.</p>

<p class="rest">Here's how my typical stack would look like.</p>

<ul>
<li>Back-end : Scala, Play! framework, Akka, PostgreSQL, AWS</li>
<li>Front-end : React.js, Redux, Webpack</li>
</ul>
