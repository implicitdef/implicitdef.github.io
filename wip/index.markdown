# Hi! I'm Emmanuel Letallieur

##I write code (for money)

####(also sometimes for fun)

I build clean, well-thought-out and scalable software and webapps. I often find myself obsessing over the smallest detail and edge case. I code, ship, and maintain.

I offer my services as a freelancer. In the past, I have worked for a data vizualisation startup, a major player of french e-commmerce, and a digital certificates company.

I'm always looking into the latests tools and languages to practice my trade. For the moment I'm deeply in love with Scala and React.js.

Here's how my typical stack would look like.

- Back-end : Scala, Play! framework, Akka, PostgreSQL, AWS
- Front-end : React.js, Redux, Webpack
