Hi! My name is Emmanuel Letallieur. I write code, for fun and money.

Passionate developer, always eager to learning the latest tools and languages to express myself.

I have worked at big companies and startups, in teams of all size, where I have consistently proven myself capable of tackling the most complex problems with elegant and pragmatic solutions.

Currently in love with Scala and React.js.

Things I like on the back-end : Scala, Play! framework, Akka, PostgreSQL, AWS
Things I like on the front-end : React.js, Redux, Webpack
